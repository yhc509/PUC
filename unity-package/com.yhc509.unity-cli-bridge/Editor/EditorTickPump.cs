    /// recording, qa run-sequence — advances one step per tick. Forcing the internal
    /// <c>EditorApplication.SignalTick()</c> schedules the next tick immediately, which measured
    /// ~1.55x faster on Unity 6000.3.10f1 / macOS (60 ticks: 9.4–10.4s → 6.0–6.1s), focused and
    /// unfocused alike.
    ///
    /// Activation is automatic and scoped: deferred flows subscribe their poll through
    /// <see cref="Add"/> instead of <c>EditorApplication.update</c> directly, and the pump runs
    /// only while at least one of them is subscribed. Because the subscriber set holds the very
    /// delegates that are on <c>EditorApplication.update</c>, the pump cannot outlive the work —
    /// a leaked pump lease would mean a leaked poll subscription, which the flows already cannot
    /// afford. <see cref="Remove"/> is idempotent, matching the defensive double-unsubscribes the
    /// poll bodies already do.
    ///
    /// <c>SignalTick</c> is an internal API. If reflection cannot bind it the pump degrades to a
    /// no-op with a single warning: deferred work still completes, just at the throttled rate.
